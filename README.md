#I'm wanting to learn how to version control with git.
#I do need to practice this whole git repo thing to better help me in the future.
#Self note: Do not edit things from Github webpages. Only use the CLI for practice.

This repo is my playground. It was made as I went through training and I am now going to use it to continue
my project work. I might move items out to another repo as time goes on but I am still practicing with
creating, moving, and versioning in GitHub. Also syncing using VS Code and GitHub Desktop.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine
for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project
on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things are needed to install the software and how to install them. For now, maybe copy in
"how to install python and python3 using apt."

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The coding language used
* VS Code
* GitHub Desktop

## Authors

* **J Hanson** - *This repo is where it started* - (http://wvroadrunners.org/) is a non profit item I work on. Not related to Python though.
